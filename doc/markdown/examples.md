## Using IrisTK in research

IrisTK is an excellent tool for doing research on spoken human-machine interaction. It comes with easy-to-use logging functionality and the dialogue is easy to design, using the provided XML-based formalism IrisFlow.  

At KTH, we have used IrisTK in many research projects. This video shows a dialog system that was exhibited at the Swedish National Museum of Science and Technology in 2014, where our robot head Furhat plays a game with two visitors. The video is best viewed in 1080p and fullscreen.

We have done several studies using this system. For example, we have used it to build data-driven models of turn-taking:

In this video, we have implemented a dialog system where Furhat can do a "Map Task" with a user:

## Using IrisTK in education

At KTH, we are using IrisTK for labs and for project work in a course called "Mutlimodal interaction and interfaces". These are some examples of systems that students have built using IrisTK (about two-three weeks of work).
