## Example: Quiz

 This app allows two users to interact with an animated agent (playing a quiz) at the same time. This requires that you have the following things:

* A Kinect connected to the computer, placed below the screen.
* The [EMBR agent](embr.html) installed an running.
* A stereo microphone connected for dual speech input, preferably a set of Singstar microphones (see below).  

You can either run the app from the command line ("iristk quiz"), or from within Eclipse (iristk.app.QuizSystem). 

### Setting up microphones

We recommend a set of wired or wireless Singstar microphones. This is how you set them up:  

1. Plug in the stereo microphones and wait until windows have detected them
2. Right-click on the speaker icon in the bottom right corner of the screen and choose "Recording devices"
3. Make sure the "USBMIC" or "Wireless Mic" is selected as default (green symbol). You should see the level bars move when you speak in the microphones. 
4. Select the Microphone and choose Properties.
5. Open the "Levels" tab and adjust it properly (watch the level meters). 
6. Open the "Advanced" tab and set the format to 2 channels, DVD quality.
7. Close all sound control windows by pressing OK

The person on the left should have the red microphone and the person on the right the blue microphone
